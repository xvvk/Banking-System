# Banking-System
## CS313 Computer Systems and Concurrency Group Assignment

##### **Project overview** 
The project consists of two parts (Part A and Part B), which are (to a large extent)
unrelated. 

Part A consists of two tasks (Task 1 and Task 2). You can implement both tasks in parallel within your group. Some aspects of the project
involve topics that will be covered in the module later in semester 1; hence, it is very likely that your
development will follow an iterative approach, i.e. implement the basic functionality first and enhance
your solution later.

Part B is a report that contains research and the development of the system.

You are expected to cover the full development lifecycle (from identifying requirements to testing)
of a Bank System that maintains and manages accounts for customers. 

Your final product must be:
concurrent & thread-safe. It is your responsibility to identify the system's requirements, but your end
product must support:
- At least three different bank account types.
- Functionality that allows account holders and bank employees to: deposit/withdraw/transfer
money, check/print the current balance and account details, create/delete/edit bank
accounts
